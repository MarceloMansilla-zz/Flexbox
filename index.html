                        <h4>Your Brain On Retail Trading</h4>
                        <p>Individual trading apps like Robinhood have become increasingly popular during the pandemic.
                            The company that owns the Robinhood app, for example, says that so many more people made
                            stock and options trades using its technology that it doubled the amount of revenues it made
                            from such trading in the second quarter, to $180 million.</p>

                        <p> Many people say Robinhood is a source for good: it doesn't charge fees and has lowered the
                            bar for entry to people who want to trade. That has introduced a lot of people to stock
                            trading and to the stock market. It might also help educate people about how companies
                            function, and how the economy works overall. All good.</p>

                        <p> But there are some downsides, too. Retail traders are particularly vulnerable to
                            overconfidence, under-diversification, and to psychological biases like the disposition
                            effect. And active stock-picking, according to decades of research, will likely be an
                            underperforming strategy for most people, who would be better off with a passive investing
                            strategy. Do all these  new retail traders understand the risks they are taking?

                        <h4>Djokovic defaulted from US Open after striking line judge with ball</h4>
                        <p>The US Open was supposed to be a slam dunk for Novak Djokovic but instead of moving closer to
                            Roger Federer in the Grand Slam record books, the world No. 1 was defaulted Sunday when he
                            struck a line judge with a ball.
                        <p></p>
                        <p>The Serb had just been broken to trail 6-5 in the first set against Spain's Pablo Carreno
                            Busta in New York when he hit a ball behind him. Djokovic wouldn't have been aiming at
                            anyone but it hit the line judge -- seemingly near the face -- and she fell to the ground.
                        </p>
                        <p> The chair umpire, Aurelie Tourte, and Djokovic, went to check on her before they were joined
                            on court by tournament referee Soeren Friemel and supervisor Andreas Egli.

                        <h4>Indian food: The best dishes in each region</h4>
                        <p>(CNN) — When ordering "Indian" food in places such as the United States or the UK, garlic
                            naan, biryani, butter chicken and dal are ubiquitous.</p>
                        <p> However, when you travel to India, don't expect anything close to a standard menu. In this
                            vast country, there are 29 states -- each with its own topography and traditions.</p>
                        <p> Head 100 miles in any direction and the religion, language and culinary customs will be
                            completely different.</p>
                        <p> The food experiences vary based on the landscape and climate, not to mention historic
                            immigration patterns, spices, trade links, rulers and religions.</p>
                        <p> In northern destinations, you might find flatbreads and tandoor-grilled kebabs, while
                            southern Indians dine on sweet coconut fish curries and rice.</p>
                        <p> Across the country, the diversity spans more than nine religions, all of which influence the
                            relationship with food. For example, Hindus eschew beef, Muslims avoid pork and Jains
                            practice strict vegetarianism.</p>
                        <p> With Covid-19 impacting international tourism, those of us in other countries probably can't
                            taste these delicious dishes in India right now, but there's no harm in whetting our
                            appetites.</p>
                        <p>From north to south, east to west, we take a deep dive into each region's history and
                            traditional dishes with insights from experts in each region.

                        <h4>The best things to do in Bariloche, Argentina</h4>
                        <p>Bariloche, Argentina (CNN) — With its snow-capped peaks and crisp winter air, this laid-back
                            mountain town in Patagonia makes some travelers question whether they have landed in
                            Switzerland instead of Argentina.</p>
                        <p>San Carlos de Bariloche, or simply "Bariloche" as the locals call it, is most famous for its
                            ever-present views of the glacial lake Nahuel Huapi, which is situated in the middle of the
                            7050-square-kilometer national park of the same name.</p>
                        <p>This Lakes Region of Patagonia is also noted for its chocolate (the fresh raspberries dipped
                            in both white and dark homemade chocolate by Rapanui are legendary), microbrews and
                            traditional Argentine asado, making this a dream destination for both foodies and nature
                            lovers alike.
